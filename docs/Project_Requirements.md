## üìå Functional Requirements:

### 1. Data Collection
- Collect YouTube data using data resources.
- Required fields:
  - Video ID, Title, Description
  - Category ID, Tags
  - Views, Likes, Dislikes, Comments Count
  - Published Date, Duration
  - Top comments with text and metadata

### 2. Data Preprocessing
- Clean and transform:
  - Normalize statistics (e.g., views per day)
  - Convert duration and timestamps
  - Clean comments (remove emojis, stop words, etc.)
  - Handle missing data and outliers.

### 3. Video Categorization
- Use Natural Language Processing (NLP) to analyze video comments and titles.
- Techniques:
  - Sentiment analysis
  - Topic modeling (e.g., LDA)
  - Text classification (TF-IDF + ML model or BERT)
- Output:
  - Assign each video a meaningful label (e.g., "Educational", "Entertainment", "Product Review").

### 4. Popularity Analysis
- Identify which features impact popularity (views, likes, shares).
- Analyze:
  - Video metadata (title length, tags)
  - Category-wise performance
  - Comment sentiment vs. video popularity
- Build regression or classification models to predict popularity (e.g., high/medium/low engagement).

### 5. Visualization & Reporting
- Create visual dashboards using Power BI, Tableau, or Python (Plotly/Seaborn).
- Show:
  - Most popular video categories
  - Engagement trends by category or channel
  - Sentiment analysis results
  - Recommendations for targeting
